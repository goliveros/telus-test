## I used a starter template that uses tailwind CSS and Vite from

```bash

https://github.com/moinulmoin/vite-react-tailwind-starter

```

## Run it locally

Clone the project

```bash

git clone https://github.com/goliveros/telus-test.git project-name

```

Go to the project directory

```bash

cd project-name

```

### Or you can just download it as zip, then

Install dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Start the server

`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
